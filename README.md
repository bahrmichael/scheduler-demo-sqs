# Scheduler Demo SQS

This repository is a demo of how one can use the [Point In Time Scheduler](https://point-in-time-scheduler.com) with a REST application.

## Prerequisites

To deploy this demo app, you need an AWS account, have `yarn` or `npm` installed on your machine, and have
an AWS profile that the [serverless framework](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started) 
can assume to deploy the application. 

You will also need to [sign in at the Point In Time Scheduler Dashboard](https://app.point-in-time-scheduler.com).

## 1. Deploy the Demo

1. Run `yarn` or `npm install` to install the required dependencies
2. Run `yarn deploy` or `npm run deploy` to deploy the demo app to your AWS account
3. When the deployment finishes you will see an API key and a URL for the receiveMessage endpoint. You will need those later.

## 2. Register the Application

[Sign in at the Point In Time Scheduler Dashboard](https://app.point-in-time-scheduler.com) and register your first application.

In the first step choose the integration type REST. Then click on next.

In the next step enter the URL of the endpoint for receiving messages. You can find it on the terminal where you deployed the application.
If you forgot to keep it, you can run `yarn deploy` again to have it printed again.

In the following step you specify the authentication. The demo app is configured to create an API key that is visible on the terminal
after deployment.

The demo app requires this api key to be passed with the header `x-api-key`, so change the header name as shown below. Then
enter the api key as the header value.

Give your app a name and description, something like "Demo App" is enough to later remember what this was for. The
description is optional.

In the last step generate an API key. The demo app will need this to call the scheduler. Copy the application id and api key.

## 3. Plug in the App ID and API key

You can provide the id and key via environment variables. Assuming you have the App ID "123" and API key "S3crEt", run
`APP_ID=123 API_KEY=S3crEt yarn deploy`. You may have to put `""` around your API key.

Wait for the deployment to complete, then open your AWS Console and navigate to CloudWatch Metrics.

After a few minutes, a new namespace called "SchedulerDemo" will appear. You should see more messages being sent than received initially.
The demo schedules them for a random point in time over the next 30 minutes.

You can modify the number of messages per minute with the environment variable `MESSAGES_PER_MINUTE`. Example: `MESSAGES_PER_MINUTE=10 APP_ID=123 API_KEY=S3crEt yarn deploy`
